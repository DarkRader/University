## Proseminars

- Proseminars are less formal than lectures (comprising both the theoretical and practical part being taught together).
- In a proseminar, students should participate more actively compared to the lecture class. For instance, students are encouraged to go through a few examples (usually short programs in C/C++) provided for every proseminar.
- Students may take the advantage of provided materials and study them in advance. This gives all students the opportunity to study at their own pace, and moreover, this provides more space for consultations and discussions during the proseminar.
