### COURSE CONTENTS
Students will understand the mathematical foundations of cryptography and gain an overview of current cryptographic algorithms. They will be able to use cryptographic keys and certificates in systems based on them and learn the basics of safe use of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic systems and hash functions in applications. Finally, students get acquainted with the basics of information security. Within labs, students will gain practical skills in using standard cryptographic methods with an emphasis on security and will also get acquainted with the basic procedures of cryptanalysis.

### GOALS OF STUDY
The module provides the fundamental theory and practical skills in using cryptographic systems. Students will understand the principles of basic crypto algorithms and the basics of secure programming and IT security. A key point is the understanding of the concept of security in the context of mathematical principles of cryptographic primitives, as well as their use in complex systems. In the seminars, students gain practical skills in using standard cryptographic methods with emphasis on security and learn the elementary cryptanalysis methods.
