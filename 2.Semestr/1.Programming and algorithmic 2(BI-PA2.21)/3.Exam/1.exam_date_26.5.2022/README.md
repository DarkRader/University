## Hash tabulka

Create a hash table (set/set) with scattering (size specified in the constructor), the key is string. constructor, Destructor and hash fce implemented from Ladi, copying constructor or assignment operator is not necessary to implement the table allows you to insert and delete elements (your implementation), and in addition to storing the order of their insertion. To do this, use the forward iterator, which you also need to create. (`++` ,`==`,`*`) created using begin () and end () (your implementation) CItem is an element stored internally in a hash table, CItem (key, nextHash, nextOrder, prevOrder); CHashTable(mFirst, mcast, mTable, mSize)
