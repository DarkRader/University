# Annotation

The goal of this course is to familiarize you with the basics of the  `Python 3.11.`

In the first part, we will cover the most important and fundamental features of the language, specifically:

- Numeric types, operators, strings
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Sequence types in general
- Functions, lambda functions, decorators
- Generators, iterators
- Exceptions

In the second part, we will delve into the more “esoteric corners” of Python and topics necessary for the final project, which includes:

- The Numpy library
- File handling
- Input, script arguments
- Classes
- Data structure serialization
- Modules, packages
- Program testing
- The standard library
- The Pandas library

And if there’s time, we might also look into Matplotlib and integrating Python with the C language.
