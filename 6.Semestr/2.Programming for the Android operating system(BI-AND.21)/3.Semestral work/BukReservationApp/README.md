# Buk Reservation System

## Description of Android app

This is a reservation system that allows you to reserve a club rooms from the **Buben Student Club**. It automates the reservation process and simplifies the process for both the manager and the reservationist. The application communicates with the my API server written on Python which communicate with student information system IS, which takes the data needed for booking about users and adds the created event to Google calendar.

In an android app I decided to make UI stuffing for my API, but at the same time some of the functions are possible to view offline, as most of the data is stored on internal storage.

## What the app is able to do
Through the app you are able to log in with your IS account, see all available reservations, and make your own reservation in the space you want and for the time that suits you. You will also be able to view all your reservations in your profile. If you are a room manager, you will also be able to make a calendar and mini service for the application, change or delete them.
