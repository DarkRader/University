# Course annotation

The aim of the course is to provide knowledge and skills needed for the development of smaller and larger information systems. Students will get acquainted with general theoretical concepts and will be able to apply these concepts using libraries and tools from the ecosystem of the Java programming language. After completing the course students will be able to participate in the development of software systems on the Java platform.

## Semestral Work

Semestral project is a clientâ€“server application working with at least 3 domain types that implements full CRUD (operations create, read, update, delete) over all of them.

### Business operation that will be implemented in the client:

- The application provides the possibility of renting swords from website.
- Renters can rent swords that are available.
- Renters may have a list of swords they want to rent. If the sword from this list is not currently available, then when he is released, renter will receive an alert "watchdog".
- When the contract is deleted, it ceases to be valid. At this point, the swords become free and the people who have these swords in the wishlist will receive notifications


### Relational data model:
