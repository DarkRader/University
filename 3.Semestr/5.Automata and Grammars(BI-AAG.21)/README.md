<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
Students are introduced to basic theoretical and implementation principles of the following topics: construction, use and mutual transformations of finite automata, regular expressions, and regular grammars, context-free grammars, construction and use of pushdown automata, and translation grammars and transducers. They know the hierarchy of formal languages and they understand the relationships between formal languages and automata. They are introduced to the Turing machine and complexity classes P and NP.

<h3>GOALS OF STUDY</h3>
The module introduces students to finite automata, regular expressions, grammars, and translation finite automata, with an emphasis on their practical use. Furthermore, the module introduces students to the class of context-free languages, basic use of pushdown automata, as well as the classification of languages.

<h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
Knowledge of basic data structures and computer programming.
