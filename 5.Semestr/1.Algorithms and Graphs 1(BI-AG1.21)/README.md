<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
The course covers the basics of efficient algorithm design, data structures, and graph theory, belonging to the core knowledge of every computing curriculum.  It links and partially develops the knowledge from the course BI-DML.21, in which students acquire the knowledge and skills in combinatorics necessary for evaluating the time and space complexity of algorithms. The course also follows up knowledge from BI-MA1.21, the practical usage of asymptotic mathematics, in particular, the asymptotic notation.

<h3>COURSE CONTENTS</h3>
The course covers the basics of efficient algorithm design, data structures, and graph theory, belonging to the core knowledge of every computing curriculum. Students learn techniques of proofs of correctness of algorithms and techniques of asymptotic mathematics for estimation of their complexity in the best, worst, or average case (the course includes basics from probability theory needed for understanding randomized algorithms). Within exercises, students learn applications of studied algorithms for solving practical problems.

<h3>GOALS OF STUDY</h3>
Students learn basic techniques for proving the correctness of algorithms and techniques of asymptotic mathematics for estimation of their complexity in the best, worst, or average case.

<h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
Active algorithmic skills for solving basic types of computational tasks, programming skills in C++ (e.g., the level needed for passing BI-PA1.21 and BI-PA2.21) , and knowledge of basic notions from mathematical analysis and combinatorics are expected (e.g., by passing BI-DML.21 a BI-MA1.21). Students are expected to take the concurrent course BI-AAG.21 and BI-MA2.21.
